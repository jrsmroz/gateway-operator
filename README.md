# Kong Gateway Operator

A [Kubernetes Operator][k8soperator] for the [Kong Gateway][kong].

### Deployment

Prior to deployment, Kong and [Gateway API][gwapi] CRDs need to be deployed:

```console
kubectl kustomize https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl kustomize https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
```

Deploy the operator with the following one-liner:

```console
kubectl kustomize https://github.com/kong/gateway-operator/config/default | kubectl apply -f -
```

Optionally, you can wait for the operator with:

```console
kubectl -n kong-system wait --for=condition=Available=true deployment/gateway-operator-controller-manager
```

[gwapi]:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api

#### Usage

After deployment usage is driven primarily via the [Gateway][gwapi] resource.
You can deploy a `Gateway` resource to the cluster which will result in the
underlying control-plane (the [Kong Kubernetes Ingress Controller][kic]) and
the data-plane (the [Kong Gateway][kong-ce]).

For example, deploy the following `GatewayClass`:

```yaml
kind: GatewayClass
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
metadata:
  name: kong
spec:
  controllerName: konghq.com/gateway-operator
```

and `Gateway`:

```yaml
kind: Gateway
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
metadata:
  name: kong
spec:
  gatewayClassName: kong
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
```

Wait for the `Gateway` to be `Ready`:

```console
kubectl -n kong-system wait --for=condition=Available=true deployment/gateway-operator-controller-manager
```

Once `Ready` you'll be able to receive the default IP address of the `Gateway`:

```console
$ kubectl get gateway kong
NAME   CLASS   ADDRESS        READY   AGE
kong   kong    172.18.0.240   True    97s
```

The `Gateway` is now accessible via that IP:

```console
$ curl -s -w '\n' http://172.18.0.240
{"message":"no Route matched with those values"}
```

(NOTE: if your cluster can not provision `LoadBalancer` type `Services` then
the IP you receive may only be routable from within the cluster).

(NOTE: the `no Route matched` result is normal for a `Gateway` with no
configuration. Create `Ingress`, `HTTPRoute` and other resources to start
routing traffic to your applications. See the [Ingress Controller
Guides][kic-guides] for more information).
